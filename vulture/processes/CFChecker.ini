Title = CF-Conventions File Checker
Abstract =  This form allows you to run the "cfchecks.py" script to check that the contents of a NetCDF file comply with the Climate and Forecasts (CF) Metadata Convention. The CF-checker was developed at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, UK Met Office by Rosalyn Hatcher. This work was supported by PRISM (PRogramme for Integrated Earth System Modelling). Development and maintenance for the CF-checker has now been taken over by the NCAS Computational Modelling Services (NCAS-CMS). If you have suggestions for improvement then please contact Rosalyn Hatcher at NCAS-CMS (r.s.hatcher@reading.ac.uk).
